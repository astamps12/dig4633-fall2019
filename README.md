## VR Lab: 0 Development Set Up

I haven't tried many AR/VR games and only recently have I gotten a chance to really to play these games for myself. The ones I have played are 

Virtual Virtual Reality, Vader Immortal: Episode 1, and I Expect You To Die. Very fun and all very different experiences. VR/AR technology can

be intimidating especially if you haven't tried any for yourself. Having a small taste of these games gives me an idea of how the process of making

them are like.
