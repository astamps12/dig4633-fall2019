## VR Lab: 0 Development Set Up

I haven't tried many AR/VR games and only recently have I gotten a chance to really to play these games for myself. The ones I have played are

Virtual Virtual Reality, Vader Immortal: Episode 1, and I Expect You To Die. Very fun and all very different experiences. VR/AR technology can

be intimidating especially if you haven't tried any for yourself. Having a small taste of these games gives me an idea of how the process of making

them are like.

## VR Lab: 1

The initial purpose design for this assignment is to replicate apple picking as you would do in real life for consumption.Since this is a farm that the player will be in, it was a great opportunity to play around with the
idea to gather supplies for grandma's best apple pies. The player will have to navigate through the orchard moving
haystacks and to get to the well. From there the player will then have to pick apples from the trees and fill
the well with as many apples as they desire.
